# Privacy Policy for GLASS

**Last updated:** December 25, 2025

GLASS (“the App”) is a utility application designed to help users write, view, and manage on-screen scripts and text overlays. Your privacy matters, and this policy explains what information is (and is not) collected when you use the App.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

* Text you manually enter into the app (such as scripts or notes)

This information stays on your device unless cloud features are explicitly enabled in a future update.

### Automatically Collected Information

At this time, GLASS does **not** collect:

* Personal identifiers (name, email, phone number)
* Location data
* Contacts
* Photos or media
* Messages or communications
* Advertising identifiers

Basic, anonymous technical data (such as crash reports or performance diagnostics) may be collected by the Android operating system or Google Play for app stability and improvement purposes.

## How We Use Information

Any information provided within the app is used solely to:

* Deliver core app functionality
* Improve performance and reliability

We do **not** sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.

## Children’s Privacy

GLASS is designed to be safe for users of all ages.

* The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
* There are no social features, chat systems, or public content sharing.
* No targeted advertising is used.

If a parent or guardian believes their child has provided personal information unintentionally, they may contact us to request deletion.

## Data Storage and Security

* User-entered content is stored locally on the device.
* No data is transmitted to external servers unless future optional cloud features are enabled.
* Reasonable safeguards are used to protect user data from unauthorized access.

## Third-Party Services

GLASS does not integrate third-party services that collect personal data for advertising or tracking.

Google Play services may collect anonymized data as part of standard app distribution and crash reporting.

---

## In-App Purchases

At this time, GLASS does not include in-app purchases or subscriptions.
If premium features are added in the future, this policy will be updated accordingly.
